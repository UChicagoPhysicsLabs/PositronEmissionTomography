3d Printing
===============

This setup uses multiple 3d printed parts.  They have been tested on a Raise3D Pro3 printer with a .4mm nozzle, so beware that some tolerances may be incorrect for other machines.  

The support for our 59mm PMTs can be downloaded here: [link] or the CAD files can be accessed here in .dwg (Autocad) format or here in .step (neutral) format .

A total of 8 parts need printing: one of each side (L and R), two front/back pieces, and four feet.  Note that this model was designed to fit over a 1.5" x 5/8" aluminum bar; you may want to alter dimensions as needed.

A bracket for holding the photodetector his available here:

Support for the aluminum extrusion body can be found here:

Three parts will need printing: a pair of feet and the center channel.  Note that the channel is also designed to fit the same Al bar as the PMT holder.  


If you are building your own HV power supply, an enclosure can be found here:

The bottom, middle and top will need to be printed separately, and the middle should have support added.  The holes are designed to withstand a bit of drooping but better safe than sorry.
