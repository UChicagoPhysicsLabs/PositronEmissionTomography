3d Printing
===============

This setup uses multiple 3d printed parts.  They have been tested on a Raise3D Pro3 printer with a .4mm nozzle, so beware that some tolerances may be incorrect for other machines.  

The stl files for the entire project downloaded here: `link <https://github.com/UChicagoPhysicsLabs/PositronEmissionTomography/tree/main/3D%20Printing>`_ 

The PMT supports will need a total of 24 parts made for each support: two sides, two front/back pieces, four feet, and 16 connectors.  These parts are all essentially 2d, so they could also be laser cut from 4mm thick material.  

Note that this model was designed to fit over a 1.5" x 5/8" aluminum bar; you may want to alter dimensions as needed. The ``Channel Insert`` file has a part designed to adapt the spacing to fit over a standard wooden meter stick, but it is untested.  

The ``Photodetector holder`` will keep the module in place on the linear stage.  

The body of the linear stage rests on three parts to hekp support it: a pair of feet and the center channel.  Note that the channel is also designed to fit the same Al bar as the PMT holder.  

If you are building your own HV power supply, an enclosure can be found here: **WIP**

The bottom, middle and top will need to be printed separately, and the middle should have support added.  The holes are designed to withstand a bit of drooping but better safe than sorry.
